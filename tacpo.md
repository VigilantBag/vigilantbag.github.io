Tor Against CP Offensive (TACPO) is an organization founded and breathing on the darknet. The organization mainly consists of a soon to be automated website.

The organization is based on the premise of being passive but offering a location for hackers to gather to help take down child pornographic content.

The way the website works is similar to Bugcrowd, where we have content on the site with specifics on how to submit, as well as a monetary reward paid out to successful operations.

Hello Dread,
We are a group not officially affiliated with Tor Against CP. Our goal is to gather skilled hackers around the world with a focus on taking down sites sharing or selling child pornographic content. Because we know extremely skilled darknet hackers are not necessarily motivated by ethics or morals, we provide monetary rewards for successful take downs of the offending sites and the doxxing of site administrators. Our organization is fairly new and small, but we have big visions. We place an emphasis on not being affiliated with ANY government agency as they will hinder our progress. Our operations rely on donations, those of which must be done via Monero or Pirate Chain.
</br>
We welcome you to come and explore our site and hope you will work with us to take down pedophilia content.
</br>

EDIT:
To clarify our intentions, the organization ourselves will not commence the attacks. Our intention is to be a location where skillful people can get rewarded (or motivated) to carry out these attacks. We understand the extreme difficulty of "taking down hidden services" but we are NOT new to the hacking scene. Think of us as a Bugcrowd but specifically for attacking pedophilia based content.
