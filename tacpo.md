Tor Against CP Offensive (TACPO) is an organization founded and breathing on the darknet. The organization mainly consists of a soon to be automated website.

The organization is based on the premise of being passive but offering a location for hackers to gather to help take down the problem.

The way the website works is similar to Bugcrowd, where we have content on the site with specifics on how to submit as well as a monetary reward paid out to successful operations.
