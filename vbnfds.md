We supply fire defense equipment and retardants and design and install stationary active fire defense systems. These systems include the minimum of various fire host connectios, hooked up to either a pool pump or our supplied fire pump. The most widely bought would be our perimeter defense sprinklers, with a Phos-Chek retardant tank feeding the pipes. Our most sought after systems would include a centralized, and controlled fire turret mounted either on the roof of the structure, or in another high location.  All of our systems are able to be controlled remotely and have redundacies put in place for various potential failures.

We also have recieved a very notable testimonial from a well known author on wildfires, Kurt Kamm:
<blockquote>"Not Your Grandfather's Rooftop Water Sprinklers"

"Dear Neighbors – I have recently completed the installation of a self-contained Phos-chek fire defense system on my Harbor Vista property. I thought I would share some details.

 

    The system is designed to cover the entire house and a perimeter around it with Phos-chek. Once activated the area is covered in 7 – 10 minutes.
    Phos-chek is the substance dropped by air tankers. It is milky-clear (the red dye is only used by aircraft to mark the place of the drop) and will dry and remain effective until washed off with water. It is actually a phosphate chemical which acts as a fertilizer, so it is eco friendly.
    The solution is contained in two 550 gallon tanks, and powered by a high pressure pump.
    The solution is spread by high volume agricultural type sprinklers located on the roof and around the property.
    You will need a generator to power the system (but you need a generator anyway).

 

Installation took 4 days. The trickiest part is adjusting the sprinklers. Once that was accomplished, we tested it yesterday using water, and every surface of my house was covered in a matter of minutes.

It can be turned on manually, or by a phone app (but you may not have Internet in case of a fire).

 

I spoke to my insurance agent about this. He said Malibu insurance is in a melt-down (no pun intended), and the best I could hope for is no increase in my rates. (I don’t have State Farm.) The system might prevent you from being cancelled." </blockquote>
