We supply fire defense equipment and retardants and design and install stationary active fire defense systems. These systems include the minimum of various fire host connectios, hooked up to either a pool pump or our supplied fire pump. The most widely bought would be our perimeter defense sprinklers, with a Phos-Chek retardant tank feeding the pipes. Our most sought after systems would include a centralized, and controlled fire turret mounted either on the roof of the structure, or in another high location. </br> All of our systems are able to be controlled remotely and have redundacies put in place for various potential failures.
